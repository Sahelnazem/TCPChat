# Run Instructions

**Run the Server**
   - Open a terminal window and start the server by running:
     ```bash
     python3 serverTCP.py
     ```
   - The server will start listening on `localhost` at the default port (e.g., 5000). You should see a message confirming that the server is listening.

4. **Run the Client**
   - Open a second terminal window and start the client:
     ```bash
     python3 clientTCP.py
     ```
   - The client will connect to the server on `localhost` (127.0.0.1). You should see a message confirming that the client is connected to the server.

5. **Start Chatting!**
   - In the **client terminal**, type a message and press Enter to send it to the server.
   - The **server terminal** will receive and display the message, and you can reply from the server terminal.
   - Continue typing messages back and forth between the client and server terminals.
